#Description

This project is a three-page professional bio and portfolio website. 
The home page, index.html is an "about me" page with a headshot and biographical information.
The portfolio page collects the author's development projects and has clickable, linked thumbnails and brief title/description text about each project.
    Note: These links, descriptions and images are currently placeholders for future projects. 
The contact page has a simple name, email, and message form to send messages to the author's linked email through the form.
    Note: The mailto link is currently a placeholder to prevent spam bots from sending emails to the author's professional email. 

#Functionality

All pages link to each other via the navbar located in the header. This navbar is responsive, and lengthy link
text is converted into smaller, more mobile friendly icons for a smaller screen size less than 768px wide. These
icons link in the same way that the text does. 

The page uses a combination of Bootstrap components/grid layout and customized CSS with limited media queries.
